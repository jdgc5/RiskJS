# Risk Game Project

## Overview

This project is an implementation of the classic board game "Risk." It will allow players to engage in strategic warfare, control continents, deploy armies, and conquer territories. The game starts as a turn-based game with dice rolling mechanics, but the long-term vision is to evolve it into an asynchronous multiplayer experience.

## Features

- **Player Management:** The game WILL supports multiple players, each with their own set of armies and territories.

- **Continents:** Continents are the key to victory. Controlling a continent grants additional armies and fun.

- **Territories:** The game world is divided into territories, and players can conquer and fortify them with their armies.

- **Turn-Based Gameplay:** Initially, the game is turn-based and dice-rolled, where players take turns to deploy armies, attack, and fortify their territories.

- **Dice Rolling:** Engage in battles with dice rolling mechanics to determine the outcome of conflicts. You will win if you feel a bit lucky.

- **Asynchronous Multiplayer (Planned):** The long-term goal is to transition the game into an asynchronous multiplayer mode, allowing players to participate at their own pace.
